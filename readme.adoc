== Motivation

The Java JDK includes various means of creating/consuming compressed files.
What is missing is easy way of creating _lazy streamed_ zip archive, in spirit of
`java.util.zip.DeflaterInputStream`.

This implementation relies on the fact that the PKZIP specification
allows archiving data streams of sizes not known upfront. This implies that
the archives produced will be readable only by tools aware of this trick.
Notably, `java.util.zip.ZipInputStream` is OK with that, so we use it to
test compatibility.

== Using

[source,java]
----
ZipperInputStream lzis = new ZipperInputStream(...);
----

See more detailed example in `io.github.tsabirgaliev.ZipperInputStreamTest`

== TODO

* [x] Put the correct file modification time and date
* [ ] Support ZIP64 format extensions for really BIG files
* [ ] Check duplicate file names?

Pull requests are welcome!
